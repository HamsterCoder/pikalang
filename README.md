## About

[Try me](https://hamstercoder.github.io/pikalang/)

This app came to be from my effort to learn Serbian. I quite enjoyed the experience of other language learning apps, but I haven't found any Serbian courses there. This app serves to help me and possibly other people learn and repeat some basic aspects of Serbian.

More lessons will be gradually added.

## Contibuting

## Development

Starting a vite dev server:

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Future plans

Further more, there are plans to grow this into a generic intrument for making language courses through writing lessons in json-style configs. However, the following issues must be adressed to achieve this:

-   Switching base language for courses [currently RU]
-   Creating courses for different target languages, [currently SRB]
